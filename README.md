# Clover House
Clover House is a two-page restaurant website built as a front-end project to practice semantic HTML, custom CSS styling, and responsive design. The site includes a home page, a menu, and a styled contact form, all built without frameworks. I also used this project to refine my layout skills, experiment with hover effects, and create a cohesive visual brand.

## Features
 - Fully responsive layout with mobile-specific adjustments
 - Fixed header and simple navigation across pages
 - Image-backed menu items with hover transitions
 - Styled contact form with custom focus animation
 - Consistent color palette, typography, and spacing

## What I Learned
 - Structuring pages with semantic HTML
 - Building responsive designs using media queries
 - Improving accessibility through contrast, readability, and layout
 - Using CSS transitions, shadows, and background images
 - Managing multi-page navigation and shared styling

## Technologies Used
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Google Fonts

## How to View
